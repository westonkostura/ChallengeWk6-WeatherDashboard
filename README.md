# ChallengeWk6-WeatherDashboard

## Description

The Weather-Dashboard is an interactive website which allows users to seach the weather of a city and view the current conditions, and the next 5-day forecast. The website retrieves weather data from a third-party API, OpenWeatherMap API, when the user searches for a city, or when the provided example city buttons that are provided are clicked. Each city that is searched for will be saved into localStorage where the user can view each search that was last made, up to the last 10 searches, with the button clicked.

## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, the user will input a desired location in the search field, and either hit the Enter key or press the search button to view the current conditions, which includes an icon of the current weather, the current temperature, current wind speed, and current humidity level percent. Each search will also display the 5-day forecast of the location, which includes the average temperature, wind speed, and the humidity level for each day.
When the "See Search History" button is pressed, the example buttons will be replaced with your search history, and if there is less than 10 searches in the history, a blank button will separate the example cities with the search history. The buttons can be pressed to view the location weather data again.
